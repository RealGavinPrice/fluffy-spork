# Code Refactor Starter Code


## HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This week's challenge is an on-the-job ticket. Our task is to modify this starter code in order to be accessible to everybody.

## <h1>THE CHALLENGE!</h1>
## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Changes made

The title was changed to Horiseon Digital Marketing.

The img in the hero class of the stylesheet was moved into the html in order for the alt text to be accessible. 

The container hero img in the html was altered to display flex.

The margin-top of the content and benefits classes were modified to liken the example.

Added a missing id tag in the search-engine-optimization div.

The stylesheet was simplified and structured in order of appearance.

The aside div was made an aside.
